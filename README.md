The application is now ready to use. 

**NOTE:** PostgreSQL must be installed on your machine to use this application. If you do not have PostgreSQL installed, follow the instructions in this [PostgreSQL Installation Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/postgresql/postgresql-installation-guide).

## Usage 

Once the installation steps are complete, follow these instructions to start and use the Employee Tracker application:

1. Start the Application:

    `npm start`

2. Main Menu:

    You will see a command-line interface with options to manage company departments, roles, and employees. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the options and press `Enter` to select.

3. Available Operations:

    -  View All Departments, Roles, or Employees: Select these options to view a list of all departments, roles, or employees in the database.

    - Add a New Department, Role, or Employee: Choose this option to input details for new records. You will be prompted for information such as department name, role title, salary, and employee details.

    - Update Employee Role or Manager: To modify an existing employeeâ€™s role or manager, choose these options and follow the prompts to select the employee and their new role or manager.

    - Delete Departments, Roles, or Employees: Remove specific records from the database by selecting the appropriate option. This action will display a list to choose from.

4. Exiting the Application:

    - When finished, select the `Exit` option in the main menu to safely close the application.

**Note:** Any changes made during your session are saved directly to the database, ensuring all updates remain intact for future sessions. However, running the SQL initialization and seeding, `npm run SQL`, deletes and recreates the database. This should only be used for testing and development purposes.
